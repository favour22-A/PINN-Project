% Introduction
\section{Introduction}
Integrating machine learning with scientific computing has led to the development of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), a field that leverages data-driven methods to solve physics-based problems. One of the most promising approaches in this area is Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which embed differential equations directly into neural network training \cite{raissi2019physics}. Unlike traditional numerical methods such as finite difference and finite element methods, PINNs do not require explicit meshing, making them particularly well-suited for handling complex domains and high-dimensional problems \cite{lagaris1998artificial}. Instead of discretizing the problem, PINNs embed the governing equations into the loss function, ensuring solutions remain physically consistent.

PINNs leverage automatic differentiation to compute derivatives efficiently and optimize loss functions that enforce both data consistency and governing physical laws \cite{Physics_Informed_Deep_Learning_Part1_Raissi_Peridkaris_Karniadakis}. This approach has gained traction across multiple disciplines, including fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and quantum mechanics, benefiting from advancements in GPU acceleration and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX \cite{Attention_Is_All_You_Need_Transformer_Vaswani_2017}.

Building on foundational concepts from numerical analysis \cite{heath2018scientific} and neural network theory \cite{MATH2030}, this paper explores theoretical foundations, mathematical formulation, and practical implementations of PINNs for solving differential equations. We compare PINN-based solutions to traditional numerical solvers such as SciPy's $solve_ivp$, analyze their accuracy, computational trade-offs, and optimization challenges, and assess their effectiveness in approximating solutions. While PINNs offer advantages such as direct enforcement of physical constraints, our results highlight optimization stability and hyperparameter sensitivity as key challenges, emphasizing both their potential and limitations in scientific computing.
This investigation, conducted as part of Mathematics 3030 under the supervision of Prof. Alex Bihlo \cite{bihlo2023pinn}, evaluates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) through three progressively complex case studies:
\begin{itemize}
\item First-order scalar ODE: Exponential decay
\item Coupled nonlinear system: Lorenz-1960 model
\item Second-order oscillator with hard constraints
\end{itemize}

As a math student with experience in numerical integration and Python programming, I explored PINNs through hands-on implementations, applying concepts from linear algebra and calculus to modern machine-learning techniques. This project investigates three key questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item How do PINNs compare to Runge-Kutta methods in accuracy and speed?
\item Can neural networks handle coupled systems like Lorenz-1960?
\item Do hard constraints improve solution stability?
\end{itemize}
\section{Literature Review}
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained significant attention due to advances in computational frameworks and affordable GPU computing. Existing research focuses on developing PINNs for solving differential equations in classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer.

PINNs have received considerable attention due to their ability to solve both forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). The foundational work by Raissi et al. \cite{Physics_Informed_Deep_Learning_Part1_Raissi_Peridkaris_Karniadakis} introduced the concept of physics-informed learning, demonstrating its effectiveness for nonlinear PDEs. Earlier studies by Lagaris et al. \cite{lagaris1998artificial} explored neural network-based approaches to solving differential equations, laying the groundwork for modern PINNs.

Recent advancements have expanded the application of PINNs to various scientific problems. For example, Bi et al. \cite{bi2023weather} demonstrated using PINNs in global weather forecasting, highlighting their ability to model complex geophysical processes. The development of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) \cite{liu2024kan} has enhanced the expressiveness of neural network-based solvers, offering improved accuracy in capturing nonlinear dynamics.

This section comprehensively reviews key research contributions, focusing on the mathematical properties, convergence behaviour, and practical applications of PINNs in scientific computing.

\subsection{Lorenz Equations and Their Simplifications}
The Lorenz equations, first introduced in 1960 \cite{lorenz1960}, describe the simplified dynamics of atmospheric convection. They serve as a foundation for understanding chaotic systems and weather prediction. The governing equations are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations under certain approximations, leading to a reduced-order model that exhibits nonlinearity and sensitivity to initial conditions.

As stated by Lorenz \cite{lorenz1960}, dynamic meteorology aims to study the atmosphere's behaviour and predict future atmospheric states using well-defined physical laws. The \textbf{maximum simplification of dynamic equations} helps reduce computational complexity while preserving essential system dynamics.

Shen and Bao \cite{shen2008} provide a \textbf{comprehensive review} of Lorenz models from 1960 to 2008, categorizing them into six distinct types. Of particular relevance is the \textbf{1960 Lorenz model}, which introduced non-periodic solutions that later formed the basis for chaos theory. The study highlights the evolution of Lorenz models, emphasizing key modifications such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Generalized Lorenz Model (GLM)}, which extends the original equations.
    \item Inclusion of \textbf{nonlinear activation mechanisms} for enhanced forecasting.
    \item Development of \textbf{wave-number-based parameterization} in atmospheric modeling.
\end{itemize}

This simplification of Lorenz's model plays a crucial role in numerical weather prediction, enabling the study of \textbf{hydrodynamic instabilities} and energy transfers in atmospheric systems.

\subsection{Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)}
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), introduced by Raissi et al. \cite{raissi2019}, integrate physical laws into neural networks, allowing for the solution of \textbf{differential equations} with minimal data. These networks are trained using a composite \textbf{loss function}, which includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Loss ($L_D$)}: Measures error at known data points.
    \item \textbf{Physics Loss ($L_F$)}: Ensures compliance with governing differential equations at collocation points.
\end{itemize}

PINNs leverage both \textbf{supervised learning techniques} and \textbf{partial differential equation (PDE) constraints}, making them ideal for \textbf{scientific machine learning (SciML)} applications.

Raissi's work extends PINNs beyond simple function approximations, enabling:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Discovery of governing equations} using limited observational data.
    \item \textbf{Data-driven turbulence modeling} for complex fluid dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Optimization of neural function approximations} for PDE-based systems.
\end{itemize}

PINNs serve as an essential framework for this project, ensuring that \textbf{solutions remain physically consistent} even when data is sparse.

\subsection{Neural Networks for Solving Differential Equations}
The application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to differential equation solving has been extensively explored. Lagaris, Likas, and Fotiadis \cite{lagaris1998} proposed a \textbf{neural network-based approach} to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). Their method incorporates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trial solutions} that satisfy boundary conditions.
    \item \textbf{Neural network architectures} that approximate residuals of the governing equations.
    \item \textbf{Optimization using backpropagation} to minimize differential equation errors.
\end{itemize}

This framework is based on a decomposition strategy:
\begin{equation}
    u(x) = u_p(x) + \mathcal{N}(x, W)
\end{equation}
Where \( u_p(x) \) is a function satisfying the boundary conditions, and \( \mathcal{N}(x, W) \) is a neural network trained to meet the differential equation.

\subsubsection{Advantages Over Traditional Methods}
Unlike numerical methods such as \textbf{finite elements and finite differences}, neural network-based solutions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Offer a \textbf{continuous differentiable form} instead of discrete approximations.
    \item Generalize well to new input conditions.
    \item Require \textbf{fewer model parameters} compared to classical solvers.
    \item Can be implemented in \textbf{hardware (neuroprocessors)} for real-time computation.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, their research highlights the potential of \textbf{multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs)} with \textbf{sigmoid activation functions} to approximate solutions with high accuracy. Comparative studies against \textbf{finite element methods (FEM)} demonstrate superior \textbf{interpolation and generalization capabilities} when using neural networks.

\subsection{Gradient-Based Optimization in Neural Differential Solvers}
Gradient-based optimization methods are commonly used to minimize residuals in differential equation solvers. The backpropagation algorithm is a widely adopted technique, but additional refinements include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Quasi-Newton BFGS Method}: Used by Lagaris et al. \cite{lagaris1998} for training their ANN solvers, ensuring fast convergence.
    \item \textbf{Collocation Methods}: Discretization-based strategies used in neural network PDE solvers.
    \item \textbf{Parallel Implementations}: Neural networks allow parallelization across \textbf{collocation points}, making them suitable for \textbf{high-performance computing applications}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Mathematical Writing Principles}
Effective mathematical writing emphasizes precision and clarity, as discussed in Krantz's \textit{A Primer on Mathematical Writing} \cite{krantz2017}. Key principles include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conciseness}: Avoid unnecessary verbosity.
    \item \textbf{Logical progression}: Ensure mathematical arguments are well-structured.
    \item \textbf{Audience awareness}: Write for an academic audience, particularly mathematics and machine learning researchers.
    \item \textbf{Technical accuracy}: Use LaTeX for proper mathematical notation.
\end{itemize}

These principles guide the formulation of this paper, ensuring that explanations remain \textbf{rigorous yet accessible}.

\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Neural Networks as Function Approximators}
Using the Universal Approximation Theorem, we construct a network:

\begin{equation}
u_\theta(t) = W_n\sigma(W_{n-1}\sigma(\cdots\sigma(W_1t + b_1)\cdots) + b_{n-1}) + b_n
\end{equation}

Where $\sigma$ is the tanh activation function chosen for smooth derivatives.

\subsection{Loss Formulation}
For the decay equation $u' = -u$:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (u_\theta'(t_i) + u_\theta(t_i))^2 + \gamma(u_\theta(0) - u_0)^2
\end{equation}

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Base Architecture}
\begin{verbatim}
class PINN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_layers=4, units=20):
        super().__init__()
        self.denses = [tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, 
                       activation='tanh') for _ in range(num_layers)]
        self.out = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
        
    def call(self, t):
        x = t
        For layer in self.densest:
            x = layer(x)
        return self.out(x)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Mathematical Methods}

\subsection{Mathematical Formulation}
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate differential equations directly into neural networks by embedding them into the loss function. This ensures that the neural network approximates solutions that satisfy the underlying physical laws. 
PINNs integrate differential equations into neural networks by incorporating them into the loss function. This section presents the mathematical formulation and techniques used in training PINNs.

\subsubsection{Problem Setup}
Given an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{du}{dt} = f(t, u),
\end{equation}

With an initial condition:

\begin{equation}
    u(0) = u_0,
\end{equation}

we approximate the function $u(t)$ using a neural network $N_{\theta}(t)$, where $\theta$ represents the trainable parameters of the network.

\subsubsection{Loss Function Definition}
The total loss function $L(\theta)$ used in PINNs consists of two primary components:

\begin{equation}
    L(\theta) = L_{\Delta}(\theta) + \gamma L_{i}(\theta),
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Differential Equation Loss:} This term ensures that the neural network satisfies the governing differential equation:
    \begin{equation}
        L_{\Delta}(\theta) = \left( \frac{du_{\theta}}{dt} + u_{\theta} \right)^2.
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Initial Condition Loss:} This term enforces the initial condition during training:
    \begin{equation}
        L_{i}(\theta) = \left( u_{\theta}(0) - u_0 \right)^2.
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Balancing Factor $\gamma$:} A positive constant balances the magnitude of the loss terms.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Training Process}
PINNs are trained by sampling \textit{collocation points} $t_i$ within the domain of interest. The loss function is minimized using gradient-based optimization techniques such as the Adam optimizer. One of the key advantages of PINNs is their reliance on \textbf{automatic differentiation}, which computes derivatives precisely, avoiding numerical differentiation techniques like finite differences.

\subsubsection{Extension to Systems of Differential Equations}
Multiple differential equations must be incorporated into the loss function for dynamical systems like the \textbf{Lorenz-1960 model}. The Lorenz system is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{dx}{dt} &= -y(z - x), \\
        \frac{dy}{dt} &= x(z - y) - y, \\
        \frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - kz,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

with initial conditions $x(0) = x_0$, $y(0) = y_0$, and $z(0) = z_0$. The corresponding loss function extends to:

\begin{equation}
    L(\theta) = L_{\Delta_x}(\theta) + L_{\Delta_y}(\theta) + L_{\Delta_z}(\theta) + \gamma \left(L_{i_x}(\theta) + L_{i_y}(\theta) + L_{i_z}(\theta)\right),
\end{equation}

Where each term enforces the respective differential equation and initial conditions.

\subsubsection{Higher-Order Differential Equations and Hard Constraints}
For higher-order ODEs, such as the \textbf{harmonic oscillator}:

\begin{equation}
    m \frac{d^2 u}{dt^2} + k u = 0,
\end{equation}

Where $m$ is the mass, and $k$ is the spring constant, we can either:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Transform the equation into a system of first-order equations or
    \item Solve it directly as a second-order equation by computing second derivatives via automatic differentiation.
\end{enumerate}

A key challenge in training PINNs is learning the initial condition. To address this, \textbf{hard constraints} can be imposed by defining a solution ansatz:

\begin{equation}
    u_{\theta}(t) = u_0 + t \cdot N_{\theta}(t),
\end{equation}

Which guarantees that the initial condition is satisfied for all values of $\theta$. This reduces the total loss to only the differential equation loss:

\begin{equation}
    L(\theta) = L_{\Delta}(\theta).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Computational Tools}
These computational tools are used for implementation and visualization.
To implement and train PINNs, we utilize the following computational tools:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Deep Learning Frameworks:} PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras
    \item \textbf{Numerical Computing Libraries:} NumPy, SciPy
    \item \textbf{Experimental Design:} Latin Hypercube Sampling (pyDOE)
    \item \textbf{Visualization Tools:} Matplotlib
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Optimization Techniques}
Training PINNs involves minimizing the physics-informed loss function using standard deep-learning optimization techniques:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Gradient-Based Optimization:} Adam, L-BFGS
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Learning Rate Strategies:} Learning rate decay, adaptive weight balancing
    \item \textbf{Regularization Techniques:} Weight decay, dropout (if applicable)
    \item \textbf{Loss Function Engineering:} Adjusting loss weights $\gamma$ to balance differential equation and initial condition losses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Advantages of PINNs}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Meshless Methods:} No need for spatial discretization, making them suitable for complex domains.
    \item \textbf{Automatic Differentiation:} Provides exact derivatives, eliminating errors from numerical differentiation.
    \item \textbf{Inductive Bias from Physical Laws:} Unlike standard machine learning models, PINNs embed governing equations directly into the learning process.
    \item \textbf{Flexible and Scalable:} Can handle both ODEs and PDEs with appropriate modifications.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This formulation allows PINNs to approximate solutions to differential equations efficiently, making them a powerful tool in scientific computing and optimization.
\newpage
\section{Theoretical Foundations}

\subsection{Neural Network Architecture}
As detailed in \cite{MATH2030}, the basic neural network architecture for function approximation consists of:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{N}(t; \theta) = W^{(L)} \circ \sigma \circ W^{(L-1)} \circ \cdots \circ \sigma \circ W^{(1)}(t)
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $W^{(k)} = w_{ij}^{(k)}$ are weight matrices
\item $\sigma$ is the activation function (tanh used throughout)
\item $\theta = \{W^{(k)}, b^{(k)}\}$ represents trainable parameters
\end{itemize}

The network must be sufficiently deep (4-6 layers) for differential equations to capture solution curvature while remaining trainable \cite{module13030_2}.

\subsection{PINN Formulation}
Given a general ODE:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}(u, u', t) = 0,\quad u(0) = u_0
\end{equation}

The PINN loss function combines:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \lambda_{\text{DE}} \underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \|\mathcal{F}(u_\theta(t_i), u_\theta'(t_i), t_i)\|^2}_{\text{Differential Residual}} + \lambda_{\text{IC}} \underbrace{\|u_\theta(0) - u_0\|^2}_{\text{Initial Condition}}
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_{\text{DE}}, \lambda_{\text{IC}}$ are balancing weights following \cite{lu2021deepxde}.

\subsection{Collocation Points}
As per \cite{module13030_2}, effective collocation point selection is crucial:

\begin{equation}
t_i \sim \mathcal{U}([t_0, t_f]) \quad \text{(Latin Hypercube Sampling)}
\end{equation}

Density requirements scale with solution complexity - our Lorenz implementation used $N=500$ points vs $N=100$ for the decay equation.

\section{Implementation Details}

\subsection{Network Configuration}
\begin{verbatim}
class PINN(tf.keras.Model):
    def __init__(self, num_layers=4, units=20):
        super().__init__()
        self.denses = [tf.keras.layers.Dense(units, 
                       activation='tanh') for _ in range(num_layers)]
        self.out = tf.keras.layers.Dense(3) # For Lorenz system
        
    def call(self, t):
        x = t
        For layer in self.denses:
            x = layer(x)
        return self.out(x)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Training Protocol}
Following \cite{module13030_2}, we employed:

\begin{itemize}
\item Adam optimizer with learning rate decay
\item Batch size = 0.1N (stochastic sampling)
\item Early stopping on validation loss
\end{itemize}
\section{Project Description}
This investigation explores Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) through three interconnected studies: extending a decay problem solver to the Lorenz-1960 system, solving harmonic oscillators through different equation representations, and implementing hard constraint methodologies. The work builds upon the foundational code for solving the decay equation $du/dt = -u$, which serves as our conceptual and technical starting point.

\subsection{Foundational Code Analysis}
The original implementation (Fig. 1) demonstrates core PINN components through its:
\begin{itemize}
\item Multi-layer perceptron architecture with four hidden layers (20 neurons each)
\item Latin Hypercube Sampling for collocation point generation
\item Composite loss function balancing differential equation residuals ($L_\Delta$) and initial condition matching ($L_I$)
\item Adam optimizer with learning rate $10^{-3}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{network_architecture.png}
\caption{Base network architecture adapted for all project components}
\end{figure}

Key modifications for subsequent problems included expanding the output dimension for multi-variable systems and implementing higher-order derivative calculations through nested gradient tapes.

\subsection{Lorenz-1960 System Implementation}
The chaotic Lorenz-1960 model presented unique challenges beyond the original decay problem. Our implementation required:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases} 
\frac{dx}{dt} = kl\left(\frac{1}{k^2+l^2}-\frac{1}{k^2}\right)yz \\
\frac{dy}{dt} = kl\left(\frac{1}{l^2}-\frac{1}{k^2+l^2}\right)xz \\
\frac{dz}{dt} = \frac{kl}{2}\left(\frac{1}{k^2}-\frac{1}{l^2}\right)xy 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Architectural Adaptations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Triple output layer for $x,y,z$ predictions
\item Individual loss weighting ($\gamma_x=1.0, \gamma_y=0.8, \gamma_z=1.2$)
\item Time-adaptive collocation sampling for $t_f\in\{1,5,10,20\}$
\end{itemize}

The loss landscape analysis (Fig. 2) revealed differential equation residuals dominated initial condition errors by factors of 3-5, necessitating dynamic loss balancing during training.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{lorenz_loss.png}
\caption{Loss component evolution showing $L_\Delta$ dominance in Lorenz system}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Harmonic Oscillator Representations}
The second-order harmonic oscillator $mu'' + ku = 0$ was implemented through two distinct approaches:

\textbf{First-Order System:}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
u' = v \\
v' = -\frac{k}{m}u 
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Direct Second-Order:}
\begin{equation*}
u'' = -\frac{k}{m}u
\end{equation*}

Implementation required careful handling of second derivatives through nested automatic differentiation:

\begin{verbatim}
with tf.GradientTape(persistent=True) as tape2:
    tape2.watch(t)
    u = model(t)
du_dt = tape2.gradient(u, t)
d2u_dt2 = tape.gradient(du_dt, t)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Hard Constraint Methodologies}
Building on Lagaris' work, we developed constraint-enforcing ansätze:

\textbf{First-Order System:}
\begin{equation*}
u(t) = u_0 + t\mathcal{N}_u(t), \quad v(t) = v_0 + t\mathcal{N}_v(t)
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Second-Order Taylor Expansion:}
\begin{equation*}
u(t) = u_0 + v_0t + t^2\mathcal{N}(t)
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Trigonometric Variant:}
\begin{equation*}
u(t) = u_0\cos(\omega t) + \frac{v_0}{\omega}\sin(\omega t) + t^2\mathcal{N}(t)
\end{equation*}

\textbf{Future Directions:} Hybrid architectures combining PINNs with spectral methods show promise for addressing spectral bias, while quantum-accelerated training could mitigate computational costs.
This study examined the effectiveness of PINNs in solving differential equations, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Further research is needed to enhance performance and extend PINNs to broader applications.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
Method & L2 Error (1P) & L2 Error (5P) & Runtime (min) \\
\hline
PINN (1st-order) & 2.1e-3 & 8.7e-2 & 142 \\
PINN (2nd-order) & 1.8e-3 & 6.2e-2 & 168 \\
Runge-Kutta & 4.2e-6 & 3.1e-5 & 0.7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Quantitative comparison for harmonic oscillator solutions}
\end{table}

\subsection{Key Observations}
\textbf{Temporal Stability:} While PINNs achieved sub-1\% errors for single-period predictions (Fig. 3), error accumulation became significant beyond $t_f=5P$, particularly in the Lorenz system's $x$ and $z$ components.

\caption{Solutions for 2-period harmonic oscillator showing phase drift in PINN predictions}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Representation Impact:} The first-order system demonstrated better long-term stability (Fig. 4) despite higher initial loss values, suggesting decomposed equations provide more trainable gradient signals.

\textbf{Hard Constraint Efficacy:} While reducing initial condition errors by 82\%, hard-constrained models showed increased sensitivity to collocation point distribution, requiring 40\% more training points for equivalent accuracy.
